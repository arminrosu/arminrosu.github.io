\*[RBF]: Resting Bitch Face

# Armin Roșu

Hi, I'm a developer, I build software and teams - since 2004™. I love what I do and hope you do too.

You can find my [CV on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arminrosu "Armin's public LinkedIn profile") and my [public projects on Github](https://github.com/arminrosu "Armin's Github profile").

Most of the [technologies I've ever used are on Stackshare](https://stackshare.io/arminrosu/all "Armin's Stackshare"). You will find the most recent selection in my CV, but I included these to give you a feeling of my experience. Some of them are so odd or old, we'll have a chuckle talking about them.
